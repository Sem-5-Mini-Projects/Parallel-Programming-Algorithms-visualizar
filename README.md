# Algorithm 1 :- Matrix Chain Multiplication


 ✔️ What is Matrix Chain Multiplication (MCM) ? 

   🟠 Matrix chain multiplication is the process of multiplying multiple matrices with only a few     arithmetic operations.
   🟠The trick is to place parenthesis in such an order that the result is computed with only a few number of steps.


   Ex:-
   ## Suppose we have chain of matrices A1,A2,A3, and A4.

   Compute the product of A1A2A3A4

   Following are the different ways to compute the final answer : -

   1) (A1(A2(A3A4)))
   2) (A1(A2A3)A4)
   3) ((A1A2)(A3A4))
   4) ((A1(A2A3))A4)
   5) ((((A1A2))A3)A4)
